### Hi there ğŸ‘‹ I was born in Ankara in 2005. I graduated from Tevfik Fikret Highschool. My well known foreign languages are French and English. I have many areas of interest but my main hobbies are playing video games and hanging out with my friends. Currently, I am a freshman in Computer Science Department in Bilkent University.
